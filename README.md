## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS Media Queries
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned some projects are better when you have a desktop first approach. In my last challenge I had some struggles and I thougth it was because I didn't start my project with a mobile first mindset but after attempting to write the code I found that it was easier, at least for this challenge, to develop with just the desktoop in mind.

When it comes to coding, everything is about using your judgement. 

Dealing with images was new. Learned all about the object-fit property and how to deal with imgaes when thinking about website responsiveness. 

### Continued development

I'm getting a lot faster when it comes to these challenges. I noticed that I had the basic structure of this challenge down very quickly. The color, the fonts, placement, it all came very natural to me this go-around. 

I attempted to use CSS Grid in this challenge but later decided to stick with flexbox when I discovered that anything you can do in Grid, you can do in Flexbox and that some developers stick with one. I will learn CSS Grid at some point but for now, I'm going to focus on mastering Flexbox. 

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Image Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeogG-ZFs8&ab_channel=CemEygiMedia) - This wasn't very helpful for this specific challenge but great information when it comes images and responsive websites. 
- [Flexbox Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94&t=249s&ab_channel=SlayingTheDragon) - I'm new to Flexbox so I keep watching YouTube tutorials on the subject every time I start a new challenge. This particular tutorial made things click just a little more for me.
